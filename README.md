# Brief Survey - A clone of [Linksway Project](https://github.com/michaeliyke/linksway)

This suvey is for engaging new clients in a way that helps us find out more about their requirements. With it, they can provide details of business goals as well determine the scope/size of project they expect from HireFly SMMA.

## Nature of survey

The steps are very painless. Only Name and email are required to start and the survey itself is just a few brief questions to geard to core business needs. It is highly simplified so that even those with limited understanding of the  English language can  cope without much struggle.
