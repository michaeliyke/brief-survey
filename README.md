# Brief Survey - A clone of [Linksway Project](https://github.com/michaeliyke/linksway)

This suvey is for engaging new clients in a way that helps us find out more about their requirements. With it, they can provide details of business goals as well determine the scope/size of project they expect from HireFly SMMA.

## Nature of survey

The steps are very painless. Only your name and email are required to get started and the survey itself is just a few direct questions geard to core business goals. It is highly simplified and easy to follow so you don't need to hold a degree in English to get going with your business decisions. Try the [brief survey here!](https://linksway.cf)
